# Decisions

This file records Hong's design decisions and rulings that touch interfaces, data behaviour or what the user sees. Entries are in the order they were made; ids are stable.

## H1 (2026-10-21): Phase 1 specs approved

Specs A–D are approved, including the reliability targets and the Shipping sections.

Affects: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-21-p1{a,b,c,d}-*.md`. The plans and builds follow these specs.

## H2 (2026-10-21): Answers to the five handoff questions

All five take the proposed default:
- Passive screen capture while Hong is away: yes.
- Research is done inline (no `deep-research-interactive` gate).
- Any whisper stops the bot.
- Teleport reach is measured in the first supervised session.
- Claude may unpair, re-pair and reset the board.

Also: if there is no ground truth for the spinning-arrow solver, ship it flagged "accuracy unverified".

Affects: specs A (timing research, pairing and reset), B (reach), C (spinning-arrow solver and its flag), D (whisper handling, inline research).

## H3 (2026-10-21): Teleport reach 19/23 px was not measured on FF2

The reach of 19 px horizontal and 23 px vertical was not measured on Fossil Foundry 2. Hong assumes it is the same on every map. This is unverified; it is measured in the first supervised session.

Affects: `src/classes/classes.py` (single reach value), spec B and the route walking built from it. Claims that minimap scale or reach differs per map are not to be repeated until measured.

## H4 (2026-10-21): Merge rule

Only merge code that really works. A merges when its real-hardware targets pass. B, C and D merge only after in-game sign-off. C branches off `p1b` and D off `p1c`.

Affects: the Shipping section of each spec, branch layout (`p1a-input`, `p1b-*`, `p1c-*`, `p1d-*`) and what lands on `master`.

## H5 (2026-10-21): "Prefer false stops" applies to the lie detector and white room too

"Prefer false stops over misses" applies to the lie detector and the white room as well as whispers. Fine for now. The `docs/vision.md` edit changing "GM whisper" to "whisper" is okay.

Affects: spec D (detection thresholds and stop behaviour), `docs/vision.md`.

## H6 (2026-10-21): Away mode

Away mode runs from the start of the build on 2026-10-21. Policy questions are decided as Hong would decide them, except anything that changes in-game behaviour. Those are parked for Hong. Work may continue on a provisional, reversible choice, and nothing runs in the game while Hong is away.

Affects: how the orchestrator and its agents make decisions during the Phase 1 build; anything that changes what the character does in the game waits for Hong.

## H7 (2026-10-21): Environment while away

The game is closed. The ESP32 is plugged in over USB and paired. Live keystroke tests are allowed, but MapleStory must be confirmed not running before keys are sent. No passive capture this run.

Affects: how plan A's real-hardware checks run (keystrokes into a test window only), and means the passive-capture permission in H2 is not used in this run.

## H8 (2026-10-21): Git actions

Hong's words: "any git action you think is needed". Bounded by the specs' Shipping rules: B, C and D are never merged to master before Hong's in-game sign-off. Process limit on top: no force-push or history rewrite of `master`, and no deleting branches.

Affects: branches, commits and pushes made during the build (including pushing docs commits to `origin/master`).
